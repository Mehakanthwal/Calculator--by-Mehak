# Calculator--by-Mehak

Project Description
This project is a simple yet functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and responsive user interface designed to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience. The project showcases my skills in front-end development, including HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for implementing the calculator's logic and interactivity. This project serves as an excellent example of integrating various web technologies to create a practical and user-friendly application.
